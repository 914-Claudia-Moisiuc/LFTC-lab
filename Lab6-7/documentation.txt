The class FA 

- init(self): Initializes the FA by reading the definition from the specified file.
- print_list_of_strings(self, list_name, _list): Helper method to print a list of strings.
- print_states(self): Prints the list of states.
- print_alphabet(self): Prints the list of symbols in the alphabet.
- print_output_states(self): Prints the list of output states.
- print_initial_state(self): Prints the initial state.
- print_transitions(self): Prints the list of transitions.
- check_accepted(self, word): Checks if a given word is accepted by the FA.
- check_if_deterministic(self): Checks if the FA is deterministic.

class Transition 

- get_from(self): Returns the source state.
- get_to(self): Returns the destination state.
- get_label(self): Returns the transition label.
- set_from(self, new_from): Sets a new value for the source state.
- set_to(self, new_to): Sets a new value for the destination state.
